- avoid comparing cases and control
- sampling is completely blind. in a continuous time model
- royston and parmar
- numerical integration is easily.. integration the smoothness doesnt matter either.  differentiation is hard
- the contrast is cox semi parametrically
- cox separates time from everything else
- theres no reason for this distinction
- we do everthing parametrically
- Make it look like its Cox saying it. If we go parametric then we can get the asymptotic normality of the betas
- the step funtions will not be more informative than the confidence bands
- bernstein von misses theorem
